# MoneFi

MoneFi is a dynamic fintech platform that bridges the financial gap for minority and underprivileged business owners by providing connections to lenders, regardless of their credit score, and offers supportive educational services like professional accounting and bookkeeping. Some of the features I developed to this website include: 

  • Assembled and implemented a front-end comment form using Formik and Yup.
  
  • Designed and enabled dynamic mapping of reply comments to corresponding parent components for real-time display.
  
  • Created and implemented features such as an add reply form, edit functionality, and delete functionality for creators and admins.
  
  • Utilized SQL and C# to design and implement API endpoints, including tables, stored procedures, services, and controllers.
  
  • Implemented HTTP-based API endpoints using .NET Core, following RESTful principles and incorporating features like routing, controllers, models, and middleware.
